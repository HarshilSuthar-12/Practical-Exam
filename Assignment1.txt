=>Display Data in Proper Format 
	db.EMPL.find().pretty()
	//Pretty() function is used to get Data Proper Format.

=>Update Salary Of Employee where Name is "ST" by +8000
	db.EMPL.update({"name":"ST"},{"$inc":{"salary":8000}})
	Fisrt we have to update so  we have to write update instead of Find
	in 1st {} the condition we have to give (in our case the name is "ST" )
	and in next {}, we have to increment the salary b 8000.

=>Update Salary Of All Employee by giving an increment of +4000 each
	db.EMPL.updateMany({},{"$inc":{"salary":4000}})
	In this We have to increment all Employee salary by 4k.
	So Query would be 
	When We have More than one record to update so instead of using update we have to use UpdateMany
	
=>update role of "MSD" as "C and WK"
	db.EMPL.update({"name":"MSD"},{$set:{"role":"MENTOR"}})
	in this there is simple task to do, just one column Value we have change.
	if we not using the set operator then it will always overwrites value, so we would have to use $SET.
	now i'm changing the role of VK

=>Add a New Field remark to document with name "RS" set Remark as WC
	db.EMPL.update({"name":"RS"},{$set:{"remark":"vadapav"}})
	in this Query we have to add new fields so it will be same as we had done in last one.

=>Add a New Field As Number 11,name AK,Salary 10000,role coch without using insert statement. But for Doing So You should have a Record Added woth number 11.
	i) db.EMPL.insert({"number":11})
	ii) db.EMPL.update({"number":11},{"$set":{"name":"AK","salary":10000,"role":"coach"}})
	it is a Tricky Question, Examinor May Ask to Confuse
	in this Question we have to first add the empty documenwhich have only one field called number and then we have to just Update that document.

=>remove added New Field
	db.EMPL.deleteOne({"number":11})

=>Update the Field "RD" by multiplying with salary by 2
